        <h1>People or Just Numbers? TAP Grant Trends from 2012-2021</h1>

      	<p>Over the course of 10 years, the federal aid granted to New York state resident students whose taxable income brackets are below the national average has increased steadily. However the aid students from income brackets above the national average receive has not changed significantly.</p>

      	<p>The Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) is a New York state federal financial aid program that helps eligible New York state residents pay for tuition at in-state institutions. The program has an established set of criteria that determines the amount of aid you are granted–qualifying students can receive up to $5,000 a year. While these do not have to be repaid, they must be reapplied for every new academic year, and the amount of aid a student receives can change depending on if their answers regarding TAP’s criteria have changed.</p>

      <div class="graf">
      	<p>The average amount of TAP aid students with a state net taxable income in the range of $0-10,000 received rose from about $2,400 in 2012 to $3,200 in 2021, which is over the course of 10 years. This is an increase of about $800. The majority of these students are financially independent, meaning they do not rely on or draw from any other income besides their own.</p>

		    <p>On the other hand, the average nationwide income, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is $59,428. Students whose state net taxable income in this range, the $50,001-60,000 range, received, on average, $365 in 2012. This rose to about $416 in 2021, making for an increase of about $51.</p>

 		   <p>The most stark increase in average aid for the income brackets below the bracket the average nationwide income would fall in came in 2020, which is notably when the COVID-19 pandemic began. The average aid for both of the income brackets above the nationwide average decreased in 2020, however.</p>

		  <p>Leigh Petryssyn is the director of Success at On Point for College, a local college attainment program that serves the Central New York area. Through her work, TAP grants are a resource she helps the students she works with to attain, maintain, and understand. The most common misunderstanding among students is determining eligibility as an independent.</p>

		  <p>“If you are under the age of 24, you have to use some person’s taxes, ideally your parents’, on your federal financial aid form,” Petryssyn said.</p>

		  <p>The only ways to be considered an independent student are to under the age of 24 are if you are a veteran, a parent who can provide 50% of the financial support to your child, if you have been in foster care, are an emancipated minor (which does not apply to New York state), or if you are ward of the court, Petryssyn explained. Meeting any of these criteria makes an individual automatically considered an independent.</p>

		  <p>“Any other circumstance, if you don’t talk to your parents or have a good relationship, that doesn’t qualify you for independent status,” Petryssyn said. “Some schools will do professional judgment when you can submit paperwork of certain circumstances and they can decide if it’s enough to grant you a dependency override.”</p>

		  <p>Petryssyn noted, however, that professional judgment is only done through the school that is being attended, not the government or New York state.</p>

      <p>The caveat, though, is being designated an independent student means you will be granted less TAP aid. The assumption is that you do not have others to support, only yourself, and your source of income will cover most of your financial needs.</p>

      <p>“An independent student on paper looks like they're better off financially especially if they have no one to support,” Kate Harris, Senior Financial Aid Advisor for SUNY ESF, said.

      <p>This is because the threshold for an independent student with no dependents is $10,000, whereas the threshold for a dependent student is $80,000, which could be a combined total from both parents, Harris explained.</p>

  <p>Every student’s situation is different–there is a wide array of underlying circumstances not considered by TAP that otherwise would be. Many thought the pandemic would improve aid considerably, but that was not universal to all cases.</p>

  <p>One example Petryssyn mentioned was a case where a student barely received any aid because his single mother was forced to work three jobs, making it seem as if she made a significant amount of money.</p>

  <p>“It might look good on paper, but how that translates into real life is never going to be, it's never going to be the same,” Petryssyn said.</p>

  <p>Moving forward, Petryssyn hopes that there is a way to look at “whole situations” regarding a student. </p>

  <p>“I just wish there was more of a holistic, humanitarian approach to awarding aid,” Petryssyn said. “I wish they would raise–it has raised over the years– but, it needs to be a lot more.”</p>
